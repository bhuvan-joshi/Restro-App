# Project Consolidation Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the Chatty Widget AI Pal project to improve its structure and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Folder Structure Consolidation

1. **Consolidated Frontend Code**
   - Moved important components from `/frontend/src/components` to `/src/components/widget`
   - Updated import paths in all components to use the `@/` alias consistently
   - Archived older frontend code in `/_archive/frontend`

2. **Backend Organization**
   - Kept the .NET Core backend in `/ChattyWidgetBackend` as the primary backend
   - Archived the Node.js backend scripts in `/_archive/backend` for reference

3. **API Service**
   - Ensured a single source of truth for API calls in `/src/services/api.js`
   - Updated all imports to reference this file consistently
   - Installed axios package for API communication

### Code Improvements

1. **TypeScript Typing**
   - Added TypeScript declarations for the widget component in `/src/types/widget.d.ts`

2. **Documentation**
   - Created `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to document the project organization
   - Updated `README.md` with comprehensive information about the project
   - Added this document (`CONSOLIDATION_CHANGES.md`) to track changes

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Development**
   - Clear separation between frontend and backend
   - Consistent import paths
   - Single source of truth for API communication

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Reduced duplication
   - Clear project structure
   - Proper documentation

3. **Improved Onboarding**
   - New developers can quickly understand the project structure
   - Documentation explains how components interact

## Next Steps

1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove any remaining references to old file structures
   - Verify all components work with the new API service

2. **Testing**
   - Test all frontend components with the .NET backend
   - Ensure the widget embeds correctly on external sites

3. **Deployment**
   - Update deployment scripts to reflect the new structure
   - Ensure proper build process for both frontend and backend
